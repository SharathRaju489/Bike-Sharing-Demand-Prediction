## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands


## Conclusions
- Company should focus on expanding business during September .i.e increasing the bikes availability and marketing campaigns and can expect a low business during december month.
- The company can expect a growing demand as the company gets older, as with the help of data we can observe that the business has been growing since it's inception.
- During the winter the business has good demand and it should consider promoting the business more and during spring the business is expected to be a bit low.
- Increase in windspeed in any given day can affect the business badly.
- Snow rain affects the demand badly and business revenue can go down.
- Temparature plays an important role in the demand, people generally prefer bike at moderate to high temperatures. We see highest rental counts between 32 to 36 degree celcius.
